# Development Log

## 2025-10-28: Project Initialization

### Initial Setup
- Created GitHub repository structure
- Documented device information (2541:fa03)
- Created USB probe tool for protocol testing
- Set up development environment

### Current Status
**Device Detection**: ✅ Working
- Device is properly detected by Linux kernel
- Shows as USB ID 2541:fa03
- Four endpoints detected: 0x01 (OUT), 0x82/0x83/0x84 (IN)

**Driver Loading**: ⚠️ Partial
- Modified CS9711 driver to include device ID
- Device claimed successfully by fprintd
- Interface opens without errors

**Communication**: ❌ Not Working
- Init command (0x01) times out
- USB I/O error when reading from endpoint 0x82
- No response to CS9711 protocol commands

### Attempted Solutions

#### 1. Add Device ID to CS9711 Driver
**What we did:**
- Modified libfprint-cs9711-git AUR package
- Added USB ID `{ .vid = 0x2541, .pid = 0xfa03 }` to id_table
- Changed receive endpoint from 0x81 to 0x82
- Rebuilt and installed modified driver

**Result:**
- Device detected: ✅
- Device opens: ✅
- Communication works: ❌

**Error log:**
```
Error while sending command 0x1, continuing anyway: transfer timed out
libusb: error [submit_bulk_transfer] submiturb failed, errno=2
Read failed: USB error on device 2541:fa03 : Input/Output Error [-1]
```

### Technical Findings

#### CS9711 Protocol Structure
From existing CS9711 driver code:

**Command Format (8 bytes):**
```
[0xEA] [TYPE] [0x00] [0x00] [0x00] [0x00] [TYPE] [0xEA]
  ^      ^                               ^      ^
  |      |                               |      |
Start  Command                        Repeat   End
```

**Command Types:**
- `0x01` - Initialize device
- `0x02` - Reset device
- `0x04` - Capture fingerprint

**Expected Init Response (8 bytes):**
```
[0xEA] [0x01] [0x62] [0xA0] [0x00] [0x00] [0xC3] [0xEA]
```

**Scan Data:**
- First chunk: 8000 bytes (raw image data)
- Second chunk: 24 bytes (metadata)

**Endpoint Usage (CS9711):**
- Send: 0x01 (Bulk OUT)
- Receive: 0x81 (Bulk IN)

**Our Device Differences:**
- Receive: 0x82 (Bulk IN) instead of 0x81
- May not use same command structure
- Unknown if 0xEA framing is valid

### Next Steps

#### Phase 1: USB Protocol Probing
1. ✅ Create probe tool (tools/probe.c)
2. ⏳ Test various command structures:
   - CS9711 commands with endpoint 0x82
   - Try interrupt endpoints (0x83, 0x84)
   - Test different command byte patterns
   - Try different frame markers
3. ⏳ Capture all USB traffic for analysis

#### Phase 2: Protocol Analysis
1. ⏳ Install Wireshark and usbmon
2. ⏳ Capture USB traffic during probe tests
3. ⏳ Analyze packet structures
4. ⏳ Document any responses received

#### Phase 3: Driver Development
1. ⏳ Fork libfprint
2. ⏳ Create custom driver based on findings
3. ⏳ Implement discovered protocol
4. ⏳ Test enrollment and verification

### Resources Created
- ✅ GitHub repository structure
- ✅ README with device info and goals
- ✅ USB probe tool in C
- ✅ Device information documentation
- ✅ This development log
- ⏳ Protocol analysis documentation
- ⏳ Wireshark capture filters

### Questions to Answer
1. Does device respond to any CS9711 commands?
2. Do interrupt endpoints provide any data?
3. Does device need firmware upload first?
4. Is communication encrypted/signed?
5. Can we find any leaked protocol documentation?

### Time Estimate
- **Initial setup**: 2 hours ✅ (completed)
- **Protocol probing**: 6-8 hours ⏳ (pending)
- **Driver development**: 8-12 hours (if successful probing)
- **Testing**: 4-6 hours (if driver works)
- **Total**: 20-28 hours estimated

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Device responds to at least one command
- [ ] Can capture fingerprint image data
- [ ] Can enroll fingerprint
- [ ] Can verify fingerprint
- [ ] Driver submitted to libfprint upstream

### Fallback Plan
If no progress after 20 hours:
- Document findings for community
- Post to libfprint GitLab
- Request help from others with same device
- Consider that Windows traffic capture may be required
