# Realtek 2541:fa03 Fingerprint Driver Development

Linux driver development project for the Realtek/Microctopus MoC fingerprint sensor (USB ID 2541:fa03) found in the Minisforum AI X1 Pro.

## Current Status

üî¥ **Not Working** - Device detected by libfprint but communication fails with I/O errors.

## Device Information

- **USB Vendor ID**: `2541` (Chipsailing Electronics)
- **USB Product ID**: `fa03`
- **Device Name**: Realtek USB2.0 Finger Print Bridge / Microctopus MoC Fingerprint
- **Found In**: Minisforum AI X1 Pro mini PC
- **Interface Class**: 255 (Vendor Specific)

### USB Endpoints

| Endpoint | Direction | Type      | Max Packet Size |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0x01     | OUT       | Bulk      | 512 bytes       |
| 0x82     | IN        | Bulk      | 512 bytes       |
| 0x83     | IN        | Interrupt | 16 bytes        |
| 0x84     | IN        | Interrupt | 16 bytes        |

## Problem Statement

The device is not supported by any existing libfprint driver. An attempt to use it with the CS9711 driver (which supports similar Chipsailing devices 2541:0236 and 2541:9711) results in:

- Device is detected and opens successfully
- Communication timeout on initialization command
- USB I/O errors when attempting to read response

**Key Difference**: CS9711 uses endpoint `0x81` (IN) while this device uses `0x82` (IN).

## Project Goals

1. **Reverse engineer the USB protocol** for device communication
2. **Develop a working libfprint driver** or patch existing driver
3. **Enable fingerprint enrollment and authentication** on Linux
4. **Document the process** to help others with similar hardware

## Approach

### Phase 1: USB Protocol Analysis
- Use `usbmon` and Wireshark to capture USB traffic
- Create simple libusb test programs to probe the device
- Try variations of CS9711 protocol commands
- Test different endpoints and command structures

### Phase 2: Driver Development
- Modify CS9711 driver as starting point
- Implement discovered protocol
- Add extensive debug logging
- Iterative testing with fprintd

### Phase 3: Testing & Release
- Test enrollment and verification
- Handle error cases
- Create AUR package
- Submit upstream to libfprint

## Prerequisites

### Development Tools
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel git
sudo pacman -S libusb meson cmake
sudo pacman -S glib2-devel gobject-introspection
sudo pacman -S opencv doctest gtk-doc
sudo pacman -S wireshark-qt
```

### Fingerprint Software
```bash
sudo pacman -S fprintd libfprint imagemagick
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romainframe/realtek-2541fa03-fingerprint
cd realtek-2541fa03-fingerprint
```

### 2. Build Probe Tool
```bash
cd tools
make
```

### 3. Run Initial Tests
```bash
sudo ./probe
```

### 4. Check USB Traffic
```bash
sudo modprobe usbmon
sudo wireshark
# Filter: usb.bus_id == 1 && usb.device_address == 2
```

## Current Findings

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Device is detected by Linux kernel
- ‚úÖ Device is claimed by fprintd with modified CS9711 driver
- ‚úÖ Device opens successfully without errors

### What Doesn't Work
- ‚ùå USB communication times out on init command
- ‚ùå Reading from endpoint 0x82 results in I/O errors
- ‚ùå Unknown if device requires different protocol or firmware

### Hypotheses
1. **Different Protocol**: Device may use different command structure than CS9711
2. **Firmware Upload**: Device may require firmware to be uploaded before use
3. **Match-on-Chip**: Device may use encrypted/proprietary protocol
4. **Endpoint Issue**: May need to use interrupt endpoints (0x83/0x84) instead
